# RGB-LED-to-Arduino
Hereâ€™s a simple code to control an RGB LED (common cathode) using Arduino. Each color in an RGB LED is controlled by a separate pin, and we can mix colors by changing the intensity of each pin using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).
RGB LED to Arduino
Connect the common cathode (ground) pin of the RGB LED to the GND pin on the Arduino.
Connect the Red pin of the RGB LED to digital pin 9 on the Arduino (with a current-limiting resistor, typically 220 ohms).
Connect the Green pin to digital pin 10.
Connect the Blue pin to digital pin 11.
